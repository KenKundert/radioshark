radioshark
==========

Utilities for use with Griffin Technologies RadioShark.

This repository contains two Python programs:

giants.py:
    This program is used to convert a CSV file downloaded from the San Francisco
    Giants website that contains their 2012 schedule into a RadioShark
    Schedule.ini file. When place in the correct location, this file will cause
    the RadioShark to record all of the Giants games.

giantsd.py:
    A simple daemon that uses the same downloaded CSV file that contains the
    Giants schedule to record the games on Linux without the help of the
    RadioShark application.

To get the source code:                                                          
$ git clone git://github.com/KenKundert/radioshark.git                                   
                                                                                 
Once cloned, you can get the latest updates using:                               
$ git pull
