radioshark
==========

Utilities for use with Griffin Technologies RadioShark.

This repository contains two Python programs:

giants.py:
    This program is used to convert a CSV file downloaded from the San Francisco
    Giants website that contains their 2012 schedule into a RadioShark
    Schedule.ini file. When place in the correct location, this file will cause
    the RadioShark to record all of the Giants games.

giantsd.py:
    A simple daemon that uses the same downloaded CSV file that contains the
    Giants schedule to record the games on Linux without the help of the
    RadioShark application.

start-giants:
    A shell script that downloads the latest Giants schedule from their webpage 
    and starts the Giants daemon.

49ersd.py:
    A simple daemon that uses a downloaded vCalendar (.ics file)
    that contains the 49ers schedule to record the games on Linux without the 
    help of the RadioShark application (in development).

start-49ers:
    A shell script that downloads the latest 49ers schedule from Yahoo and 
    starts the 49ers daemon.
