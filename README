==========

Utilities for use with Griffin Technologies RadioShark.

This repository contains two Python programs:

giants.py:
    This program is used to convert a CSV file downloaded from the San Francisco
    Giants website that contains their 2012 schedule into a RadioShark
    Schedule.ini file. When place in the correct location, this file will cause
    the RadioShark to record all of the Giants games.

giantsd.py:
    A simple daemon that uses the same downloaded CSV file that contains the
    Giants schedule to record the games on Linux without the help of the
    RadioShark application.

For information about these two programs, visit

To get the source code:
    $ git clone git://github.com/KenKundert/radioshark.git

Once cloned, you can get the latest updates using:
    $ git pull

Before you can use them, you will need to install the libhid-devel, alsa-utils,
vorbis-tools, and mplayer packages. To do so on Fedora, as root run:
    # yum install libhid-devel alsa-utils vorbis-tools mplayer
